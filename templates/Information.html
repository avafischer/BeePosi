Neurons are the brain cells that are covered as well as protected with a fatty substance called myelin (Ortiz, 2018). Myelin is like an insulator that helps messages in the brain travel between other neurons, just like the electricity going through wires in a house. 
Mature neurons are well-myelinated and well-protected, but the neurons of younger and less-developed brains have to develop more myelin to become fully mature at around the age of 25 (Tomassy et al., 2014). Teens’ less-developed brain messages cause them to essentially experience more intense enjoyment from addictive activities than adults (Ford et al., 2015). Teenagers also feel negative emotions, including stress, anxiety, and depression,  in a more intense way. Teenagers could crave relief from those negative feelings, clouding their minds more than adults. When teenagers receive a notification or are in a situation that triggers picking up their device, the teenage brain’s reward centre is very susceptible to the temptation and positive feelings gained from the apps that they access and use on a daily basis.

      <div class="col-sm-6" ><h3>The Release of Dopamine</h3>



        By preying on the fragility of the underdeveloped brain, dopamine encourages unhealthy screen habits. It is the neurotransmitter that is released by the brain in anticipation of receiving an award, which eventually leads to the addiction of the good feeling of that award,  then leads to the expectation of feeling rewarded. This cycle of addiction keeps the user coming back over and over again to the source of their addiction, which leads to another cycle of wanting and receiving but will never result in total satisfaction. 
        Dopamine is associated with cases of unhealthy addictions such as junk foods, drugs, smoking, and addiction to screens. This dopamine screen cycle consumes peoples’ time with social media instead of healthier leisure activities and is a persisting issue that will continue to plague our generation with its harmful aftermath if the addiction takes a stronghold of the mind.
        Screen addictions have the same dopamine-dependent negative mental effects as drugs and gambling (Works, 2016). However, on the gambling side of the spectrum, there is the activation of the Ventral Striatum, also more commonly known as the brains’ reward centre, and plays a role in the processing of awards, which can lead to coming back and back repeatedly to the source of the good feeling (Bates, 2020). 
        Scientists are looking further into this connection and have found that “Screens and electronics are running the risk of keeping kids in a chronic state of hyperarousal, leaving them agitated, yet exhausted. This makes it harder to retain information, socially interact, and regulate their emotions”(Vinopal, 2019). A single pickup of a handheld device can set off a chain reaction of dopamine, which makes it harder and harder to resist the urge to pick it up again. Teens’ brains are especially susceptible to the factors that trigger the reward centre of the brain. Addictive behaviour increases the amount of reward-connected neurotransmitters in the brain. These substances flood the brain with dopamine, and this specific neurotransmitter flood can result in feelings of relaxation, stress relief, and euphoria.   
        dopamine is a fascinating chemical. Think of all those times that you have laughed until you cried and lost your breath. That is dopamine at work. But even though dopamine is the cause of the addiction cycle, its true job is not to make people feel good through experiences: Its true job is to drive a human to continue survival-related behaviour, like sleeping or eating, and to encourage prosocial behaviour, like forming bonds of friendship.
        The thing that makes addictive substances so risky is that their effects override the natural and healthy messages of the human brain. When alcohol and drugs unnaturally release dopamine, the brain gets the message of, “You don’t need food, sleep, or friendships as much as you need drugs and or alcohol.”
        What was once a survival instinct of the reward pathway is now a broken tool, damaged by the repetitive substance used to create an addiction.

      <div class="col-sm-6"><h3>Gaining Profit from Underdeveloped Brains</h3>



        Most social media platforms rely heavily on funding from advertisers to make a decent profit (Hartley et al., 2019). The apps that are the most popular nowadays are the ones who capitalize on the reward system of the brain and use it to their advantage to rewire those underdeveloped brains, further working on turning screen addiction into a regular habit. In order to do so, these apps work to manipulate the brain’s reward systems by designing their feeds to seem endless, further eliminating any stopping cues that would encourage users to stop and move onto something else (Price, 2019). Scientists have investigated the link between likes, comments, messages, and the engrossment of teens and their devices. Screens are continuously creating the illusion of socialization and happiness, and they also act as a ‘support beam’ to ‘help’ people with insecurities or are feeling lonely, resulting in having the exact opposite effect and taking a negative toll on teens’ mental health. This pressing issue of teen screen addiction is threatening people all over the world due to the fragility of the mind, and the chain reaction of dopamine that is set off every time one feels rewarded by the use of their handheld device.
